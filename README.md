# eWRIMS_functions_R

This repository serves as a public space for R-codes used to downland, process, and analysis water rights data from the electronic water rights management system (eWRIMS) at the [California State Water Resources Control Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/) .

Water rights data is available on both internal and public databases.  

Bulk processing of eWRIMS code is done via the "flat files", e.g. weekly data dumps into csv tables. 
[Public Flat Files](https://data.ca.gov/group/c24c78f6-318c-4c0a-9f79-58eb4f66aed8?organization=california-state-water-resources-control-board&tags=Division+of+water+Rights) 

Individual records can be examined in detail in the [eWRIMS database (public)](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/waterrights/water_issues/programs/ewrims/)

Most code is written assuming the user has access to the internal flat files and internal databases, which are nearly identical to the public databases. Code may be edited to access the public databases.
